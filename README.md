👋 Hey there! I'm a Backend Engineer with a passion for creating scalable backend systems.

Originally from India, I currently contribute my skills as a Senior Software Developer at Two Point One. 😊

My toolkit includes technologies like Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, ElasticSearch, Terraform, Docker, Stripe, AWS, and GCP.

I've had the opportunity to lead backend projects, support and mentor junior team members, and collaborate with diverse teams worldwide 🌍. Additionally, I actively engage in contributing to open-source software, always seeking avenues to expand my knowledge and grow as a developer and open-source enthusiast.
